"""Put Tikki into a Bangkok street.

What this does
--------------
The house had two halves that never met: crayon drawings of a girl and her
duck, on white paper, and — now — real Bangkok streets drawn as manga line
art and screentone. A plate is the drawing's own silhouette with the paper
lifted off, so a plate can stand on a street without a rectangular seam:
what is pasted is the drawing, and the drawing's edge is its own edge.

The street comes from "どこでもロケハン" (Location Scout), which builds a
block of a real city from OpenStreetMap and elevation data and draws it as
a manga background. Its terms allow the picture to be used inside a work,
with the credit it prints in the corner; the credit is burned into these
files and is repeated in the app and in data/sources/.

The house's discipline is that the page's own ground shows through, so the
street keeps its paper and the drawing keeps its colour.

Usage
-----
    python3 scripts/illustrations/build_streets.py            # rebuild
    python3 scripts/illustrations/build_streets.py --check    # verify

The masters are the raw captures in design/illustrations/streets/. The
served files are public/illustrations/scene-*.webp, and
design/illustrations/street-manifest.json records what each one is and
what it is made of, so the gate can measure the bytes that ship.

# The figures are the house's own plates: the drawing is pasted whole, so a
# girl who is reading still reads, and a duck is still her duck. The street
# is what changes, which is the point — the same girl in a different place
# is a different picture, and a learner who has seen her on the avenue
# meets her again in a lane without recognising the drawing.
