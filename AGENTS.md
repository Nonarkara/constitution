## This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Design quality: Non-Slop
Before any UI, page, dashboard, deck or visual work, read `.non-slop/AGENTS.md` and follow it.
`STYLE.md` lists this repo's deliberate choices: it wins over every generic rule, and nothing listed there is stripped.
Check with `node .non-slop/bin/non-slop.mjs scan .` (and `render <url>` when Playwright is installed). A different agent or person reviews; never self-review.
